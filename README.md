# üöÄ Cloud Infrastructure Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer Challenge!** üéâ This challenge is designed to evaluate your ability to work with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, AWS networking, IAM, and automation using modern DevOps practices.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use **any IaC tool of your choice** (Terraform preferred, but alternatives are allowed). If you choose a different tool or a combination of tools, **justify your decision!**

## ‚ö° Challenge Overview

Your task is to deploy the following infrastructure on AWS:

> üéØ **Key Objectives:**

- **An API Gateway** with a single endpoint (`GET /info`).
- **A Lambda function** triggered by the API Gateway.
- **A database instance or application backend** running in a private subnet. This can be:
  - A **PostgreSQL RDS instance** üì¶
  - A **self-hosted database** on an EC2 instance üîó
  - A **deployed application** such as WordPress hosted on EC2 üé®
- **The Lambda function must connect** to the database/backend and return basic information about its connection and status.
- **Logs from the Lambda** should be visible in CloudWatch üìä
- **Networking must include:** VPC, public/private subnets, and security groups.
- **The Lambda must be in a private subnet** and use a NAT Gateway in a public subnet for internet access üåç

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that your solution is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices for security and maintainability.

## üìå Requirements

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

> ‚ö° **Must Include:**

- **IaC:** Any tool of your choice (**Terraform preferred**, but others are allowed if justified).
- **AWS Services:** VPC, API Gateway, Lambda, CloudWatch, NAT Gateway, RDS or EC2.

### üì¶ Deliverables

> üì• **Your submission must be a Pull Request that must include:**

- **An IaC module** that deploys the entire architecture.
- **A `README.md`** with deployment instructions and tool selection justification.
- **A working API Gateway endpoint** that responds with a JSON payload from the Lambda, including:
  - Connection status to the database or backend.
  - Basic metadata about the target system (e.g., DB version, instance type, WordPress version, etc.).
- **CloudWatch logs** from the Lambda.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `docs` folder to store any additional documentation or diagrams that help explain your solution.
> Mention any assumptions or constraints in your `README.md`.

## üåü Nice to Have

> üí° **Bonus Points For:**

- **Auto Scaling & High Availability**: Implementing **Multi-AZ for RDS** or an **Auto Scaling Group for EC2** to improve availability.
- **Load Balancer or CloudFront**: Adding an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **CloudFront** for distributing traffic efficiently.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Implementing **automated backups for RDS** or **snapshot strategies**.
- **GitHub Actions for validation**: Running **`terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`**, or equivalent for the chosen IaC tool.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Ensuring linting and security checks before committing.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Setting up **AWS CloudWatch Alarms for infrastructure health (e.g., RDS CPU usage, EC2 status)**.
- **Docker for local testing**: Using Docker to **simulate infrastructure components** (e.g., a local PostgreSQL instance).

## üì• Submission Guidelines

> üìå **Follow these steps to submit your solution:**

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Create a feature branch** for your implementation.
3. **Commit your changes** with meaningful commit messages.
4. **Open a Pull Request** following the provided template.
5. **Our team will review** and provide feedback.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

> üîç **What we'll be looking at:**

- **Correctness and completeness** of the deployed **infrastructure**.
- **Use of best practices for networking and security** (VPC, subnets, IAM).
- **Scalability & High Availability considerations** (optional. e.g., Multi-AZ, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer).
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery strategies** implemented (optional).
- **CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks** (optional).
- **Documentation clarity**: Clear explanation of infrastructure choices and configurations.

## üõ† Development Workflow

- Install the tooling once (`brew install pre-commit tflint tfsec libpq` or use the official binaries/pip) and link the PostgreSQL client (`brew link --force libpq`).
- Install the Session Manager plugin for AWS CLI (`brew install --cask session-manager-plugin`) to enable SSM port forwarding.
- Enable the hooks with `pre-commit install`; they enforce `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`, `tflint` and `tfsec` before every commit.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` or `terraform fmt -recursive` locally to check formatting on demand.
- The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/gitops.yml`) repeats the same checks (`fmt`, `validate`, `tflint`, `tfsec`) and blocks merges when any lint or security finding appears.
- Define the GitHub repository secrets `AWS_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN` and `CI_TESTER_PRINCIPALS` (ARNs of the principals that can assume the tester role) so that the pipeline and your local sessions can federate.

## üîê Accessing Aurora via SSM Bastion

- Terraform provisions a private EC2 instance (SSM managed) and an Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 cluster fronted by an RDS Proxy with IAM authentication.
- After deployment, retrieve outputs:
  ```bash
  terraform output ec2_instance_id
  terraform output database_proxy_endpoint
  terraform output database_master_username
  terraform output database_iam_token_username
  ```
- Establish an SSM port forwarding session against the writer when you need to execute administrative commands:
  ```bash
  aws ssm start-session \
    --target <ec2_instance_id> \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
    --parameters '{"host":["<proxy-endpoint>"],"portNumber":["5432"],"localPortNumber":["5432"]}' \
    --region us-east-1
  ```
- With the password stored in Secrets Manager (`terraform output database_credentials_secret_arn`) create the IAM-dedicated user once and enable the necessary permissions:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER <database_iam_token_username> WITH LOGIN;
  GRANT rds_iam TO <database_iam_token_username>;
  GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE app TO <database_iam_token_username>;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO <database_iam_token_username>;
  ```
- Generate an IAM auth token (replace the region/account accordingly):
  ```bash
  aws rds generate-db-auth-token \
    --hostname <proxy-endpoint> \
    --port 5432 \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --username <database_iam_token_username>
  ```
- Use the token as the password in your PostgreSQL client. If you see authentication errors, verify that `<database_iam_token_username>` retains the `rds_iam` grant.
